this score is very complex
see the IMSLP score in parent dir.
many beams above barlines...


some resulting problems in the MIDI:

- one missing 8th note between 3/4 and 2/4, after fermata (marked bW), 
- and one between 2/4 and 3/4 (marked dbW). 
- one extra 8th (error g.n.) before fermata of intermezzo II (noted W). 
- 2 unmarked 2/4 bars twice w. repeat (marked dbW and bW).
