#### curation procedure

...


---
#### objectives

build a dataset containing
- score files 
- MIDI performances
- down-beat / beat annotation (dates in performance)


usage:
- usage:
  - ground truth for position of bars (in MIDI perfo)
    â†’ evaluation of beat tracking
  - ground truth for evaluation of transcription
    (bar-by-bar transcription taking the bar positions in input)
    

---
#### source Dataset
the dataset is obtained by curating the following dataset by Jeong et al.
(manual cleaning of the beat mark annotations)


- this dataset is used for the evalution of `VirtuosoNet` 
  https://github.com/jdasam/virtuosoNet
- the dataset is not public
- solo piano music, polyphonic, symbolic (MIDI + annote)

for each opus:
- MIDI performance
  from Yamaha competition
- musicXML score
  from musescore
- MIDI quantified (MIDI score)
  obtained from musicXML with Musescore
- alignement (txt file) 
  obtained from the 2 MIDI files with following Nakamura algo.
  = ground truth?

#### dataset content and curation procedure

available at:  
https://github.com/fosfrancesco/performed-midi-dataset

You can test with every piece of one of the following authors:
- Bach
- Balakirev
- Beethoven
- Chopin
- Glinka
- Haydn
- Liszt
- Mozart
- Prokofiev
- Rachmaninoff
- Ravel
- Schubert
- Schumann
- Scriabin

The procedure is:
- Choose a Folder from the dataset (from authors above)
- Open Audacity https://www.audacityteam.org/
- File -> Import ->MIDI file: `midi_cleaned.mid`
- File -> Import ->Labels: `ann_quant.txt`
- File -> Import ->Audio: `quant_click.wav`
- Labels are annotated as `b` beat or `db` downbeat
- Labels that were automatically detected to have some problems are annotated with `W` after the name.

To export labels: File -> Export -> Labels : `ann_quant_cleaned.txt`

Test it, but don't work on it yet, because I need to figure out why it doesn't work for some authors.
